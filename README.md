# Internship-5-6
The primary objective of this project is to design and develop a machine learning-based system capable of detecting phishing websites. By analyzing a dataset of website features, the model aims to identify malicious websites with high accuracy, ensuring improved online security for users.
Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project contains details of websites, including URL characteristics, domain information, and metadata. The key features include:
•	URL length, presence of special characters, and keyword usage.
•	Domain-based attributes such as SSL certificate validity and DNS records.
•	Target Variable: A binary indicator (1 for phishing websites, 0 for legitimate websites).
The dataset consists of 10,000 samples, with no missing values after preprocessing.

Methodology
The following steps were implemented to achieve the project's goals:
1.	Data Preprocessing:
o	Handled non-numeric features (e.g., URLs) by encoding them using one-hot encoding.
o	Standardized numerical data to ensure consistent scaling across features.
2.	Feature Selection:
o	Applied Random Forest feature importance to identify critical features contributing to phishing detection.
3.	Model Training:
o	Trained and evaluated six machine learning models:
	Logistic Regression
	Random Forest
	Support Vector Machine (SVM)
	Decision Tree
	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	Naive Bayes
4.	Model Evaluation:
o	Models were evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.
o	Visualizations like ROC curves and confusion matrices were generated for interpretability.
5.	Performance Comparison:
o	A comparative analysis of all models was performed, selecting the best-performing model for deployment.

Results
The Random Forest model emerged as the most effective algorithm, achieving:
•	Accuracy: 95%
•	ROC-AUC Score: 0.98
•	Confusion Matrix: Demonstrated low false positive and false negative rates.
Other models like Logistic Regression and SVM provided moderate performance but were less consistent in recall and precision.

Insights
Feature importance analysis highlighted:
•	URL length and SSL certificate validity as critical indicators of phishing websites.
•	The presence of certain keywords like "login" or "secure" in the URL also contributed significantly to predictions.
These insights could guide future cybersecurity solutions and awareness campaigns.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms in identifying phishing websites. The selected Random Forest model can serve as the backbone for a real-time phishing detection tool. Future work includes integrating the model into web browsers or creating an API for widespread use.
